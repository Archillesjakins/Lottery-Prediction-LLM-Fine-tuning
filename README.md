# Lottery-Prediction-LLM-Fine-tuning


## üöÄ **Project Overview**

This project is built to experiment with fine-tuning LLMs on structured data to explore their potential in analyzing patterns within historical lottery results. While the predictions may not guarantee real-world outcomes (since lottery numbers are random), this project serves as an excellent showcase for training and fine-tuning LLMs using domain-specific data.

### **Key Features**
- Preprocessing of historical lottery data.
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM for lottery number generation.
- Input-output format customization for data representation.
- Evaluation and analysis of the model's performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup**

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv or pip for managing dependencies.
- CUDA (if running with GPU support).

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lottery-Prediction-LLM-Fine-Tuning.git
   cd Lottery-Prediction-LLM-Fine-Tuning
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or provide historical lottery data in JSON format, structured with keys for inputs (e.g., `history`) and outputs (e.g., `target`).

## üìä **Dataset Format**

Your input dataset should be in a JSON file with each line representing a lottery draw as a JSON object. For example:

```json
{
    "history": [50, 36, 3, 38, 17, 9, 30],
    "target": [10, 23, 22, 15, 5]
}
```

## üîß **Fine-Tuning Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Transform the dataset into a format suitable for training:
     ```python
     {
         "text_input": "50 36 3 38 17 9 30",
         "output": "10 23 22 15 5"
     }
     ```

2. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Use a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT) and fine-tune it using a framework like Hugging Face's `transformers`. Run the fine-tuning script:
     ```bash
     python train.py --data_file lottery_dataset.json --epochs 5 --batch_size 32
     ```

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Test the fine-tuned model on a validation set to measure performance.

4. **Inference**:
   - Generate lottery predictions based on historical data:
     ```python
     python predict.py --model_path ./fine_tuned_model --input "50 36 3 38 17 9 30"
     ```

## üß† **Key Files**
- `train.py`: Script for fine-tuning the model on lottery data.
- `predict.py`: Script for generating predictions.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Prepares the dataset for fine-tuning.
- `lottery_dataset.json`: Sample historical lottery data for training.

## üìà **Model Architecture**

This project uses a pre-trained transformer-based LLM (e.g., GPT-2) for fine-tuning. The training leverages sequence-to-sequence learning, where:
- **Input**: Historical lottery numbers (e.g., `"50 36 3 38 17 9 30"`).
- **Output**: Target lottery numbers (e.g., `"10 23 22 15 5"`).

### **Hyperparameters**
You can customize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs in the `config.json` file.

---

## üí° **Use Cases**
- Experimentation with fine-tuning LLMs for numeric sequence prediction.
- Learning how to preprocess and train models on structured datasets.
- Showcasing the potential of AI in pattern recognition.
